# 50 Projects in 50 Days - HTML/CSS and JavaScript Projects

50 unique mini-projects to sharpen your HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript Skills by Brad Traversy and Florin Pop. 

Despite the name, I will not be doing them back-to-back everyday. I am doing these in conjunction with [FrontendMentor challenges](https://github.com/ppusher/frontend-mentor-challenges) every other day.


##### Tasks : 
- This is an incomplete readme file, it will be updated periodically. 
- Build a showcase page similar to the 50projects50days.com website to display all my completed and pending projects.
